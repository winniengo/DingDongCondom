Ding Dong: Condom! is an Android on-demand delivery app for promoting safe sexual health practices on Swarthmore Collegeâ€™s campus. It was the core technical component of our final project for our Computer Science Senior Conference focusing on the topic of Mobile Health.

As *hook-up* culture on college campuses becomes increasingly prevalent and steadily accepted, the risk of unwanted pregnancy or contracting STIs and STDs rises proportionally. Condoms are one of the most effective ways to promote safe sex and sexual health practices. Ding Dong: Condom! fills a unique niche in mobile health by providing users the ability to anonymously order condoms to their dorms. With popular on-demand delivery apps in mind, we designed the look and functionality of our app to appeal to users already familiar with apps like Uber or Lyft.
